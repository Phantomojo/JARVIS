# Local Autonomous AI Agent Project

## Phase 1: Research and assess available components
- [ ] Research DeepSeek R1 capabilities and API
- [ ] Research Blackbox code generator integration options
- [ ] Investigate WSL Ubuntu setup requirements
- [ ] Explore interface options for the agent window
- [ ] Research multi-agent architecture patterns
- [ ] Identify necessary libraries and frameworks

## Phase 2: Design the autonomous agent architecture
- [ ] Define the overall system architecture
- [ ] Design the agent loop mechanism
- [ ] Plan the interface between components
- [ ] Design the memory and state management system
- [ ] Create diagrams for the architecture

## Phase 3: Develop the agent interface and core components
- [ ] Set up the development environment
- [ ] Develop the agent interface window
- [ ] Implement the core agent loop
- [ ] Create the memory management system
- [ ] Implement the task planning system

## Phase 4: Implement integration with DeepSeek R1 and other tools
- [ ] Integrate DeepSeek R1 API
- [ ] Set up Blackbox code generator integration
- [ ] Implement tool use framework
- [ ] Create the execution environment for generated code
- [ ] Implement file system access

## Phase 5: Test and refine the autonomous agent
- [ ] Test basic functionality
- [ ] Test complex task handling
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Fix bugs and issues
- [ ] Implement user feedback

## Phase 6: Deliver final implementation and documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Prepare installation instructions
- [ ] Document usage examples
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Deliver final code and assets
